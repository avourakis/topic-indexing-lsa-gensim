An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale.
The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer.
As a discipline, computer science spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.
Data structures and algorithms is the study of commonly used computational methods and their computational efficiency.
