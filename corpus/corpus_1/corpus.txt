Artificial intelligence (AI, also machine intelligence, MI) is Intelligence displayed by machines, in contrast with the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals.
AI research is defined as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.
The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
Machine learning, a fundamental concept of AI research since the field's inception, is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience.
Natural language processing gives machines the ability to read and understand human language.
Biology is the natural science that involves the study of life and living organisms, including their physical and chemical structure, function, development and evolution.
Although modern biology is a relatively recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times.
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a common origin.
One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination.
It is also understood that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment.
